# LOVELYSTAY Challenge

Github Users API
* In this application you can search for a user by username and you will be able to see their information such as avatar name and repositories.

# Installation

You will need to install node.js (``https://nodejs.org/en/``). I use node version 16.13.1

Once done, open the Terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nunoaleixo90/LovelyStay-Challenge.git
```

When finished, access the folder lovelystay-challenge, and run:

```bash
npm install
```

And finally:

```bash
npm start
```
